<h2> :collision: Problem Statement: </h2>
<p>As we all know in this busy life where all of us are busy not able to give time to our body or Workout.First and the foremost reason to being sick is not taking good diet or having exercise on daily basis. So caring or taking of body just like different non living things is also necessary.One of the problem faced by the people is that they are not able to remind that at what time we have to do exercise or check BMI.This gives us many issues </p>

This app also helps the user to search about the exercise as per you body issues like REST API.
